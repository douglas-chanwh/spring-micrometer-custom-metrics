Micrometer with Spring Boot and Key Prometheus Metrics
1. How Micrometer Works with Spring Boot
   Micrometer is a vendor-neutral application metrics facade that supports numerous monitoring systems, including Prometheus. Here's how it integrates with Spring Boot:

Auto-configuration: Spring Boot automatically configures Micrometer when you add the spring-boot-starter-actuator dependency.
Metrics Collection: Micrometer collects various metrics out-of-the-box, including JVM, CPU, and memory metrics.
Custom Metrics: You can easily define custom metrics using Micrometer's API:
javaCopy@Autowired
private MeterRegistry meterRegistry;

// Counter
Counter.builder("my.custom.counter").register(meterRegistry).increment();

// Gauge
Gauge.builder("my.custom.gauge", myObject, MyObject::getValue).register(meterRegistry);

// Timer
Timer.builder("my.custom.timer").register(meterRegistry).record(() -> {
// timed code
});

Prometheus Endpoint: Spring Boot exposes the /actuator/prometheus endpoint, which Prometheus can scrape to collect metrics.

2. Interpreting Key Prometheus Metrics from Spring Boot
   Here are 20 important metrics exposed by Spring Boot's Prometheus endpoint:

process_cpu_usage: CPU usage of the JVM process.
system_cpu_usage: Overall system CPU usage.
jvm_memory_used_bytes: JVM memory usage.
jvm_memory_max_bytes: Maximum available JVM memory.
jvm_gc_pause_seconds: Garbage collection pause times.
http_server_requests_seconds: Latency of HTTP requests.
tomcat_active_sessions: Number of active sessions in Tomcat.
tomcat_threads_current: Current number of threads in Tomcat.
hikaricp_connections_active: Active connections in HikariCP connection pool.
hikaricp_connections_idle: Idle connections in HikariCP connection pool.
system_load_average_1m: System load average over 1 minute.
jvm_threads_states: JVM thread states (runnable, blocked, waiting).
logback_events_total: Total number of logging events by level.
disk_free_bytes: Free disk space.
disk_total_bytes: Total disk space.
application_ready_time_seconds: Time taken for the application to be ready.
application_started_time_seconds: Time taken for the application to start.
spring_cloud_circuit_breaker_calls: Circuit breaker calls (if using Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker).
spring_integration_send_seconds: Time taken for Spring Integration message sends.
spring_kafka_listener_seconds: Time taken for Kafka message processing (if using Spring Kafka).

Interpretation tips:

Monitor trends over time rather than absolute values.
Set up alerts for sudden spikes or drops.
Correlate different metrics for a comprehensive view of application health.
Use Grafana or similar tools for visualization and easier interpretation.
